# UI Style Guide

## Visual Direction
- Tone: control-room intelligence, high signal-to-noise.
- Palette: cyan + amber + mint over deep blue atmosphere.
- Typography:
  - Display: Space Grotesk
  - Body: Manrope
  - Monospace: JetBrains Mono

## Layout Rules
- Keep summary hierarchy clear: headline -> risk -> evidence -> action.
- Use cards for operational chunks, not decorative clutter.
- Preserve high contrast in data-dense panels.

## Motion Rules
- Use meaningful transitions for context change.
- Avoid perpetual animation in dense tables/charts.
- Reserve pulse animations for status indicators.

## Risk Language
- LOW: stable, monitor routine cadence.
- ELEVATED: monitor closely, schedule near-term checks.
- HIGH: immediate triage and controlled intervention.
- CRITICAL: operational escalation path.

## Dashboard Expectations
- Home page: executive context + live queue + trend signal.
- VIN page: evidence-backed recommendations + export/approval.
- Cohort page: anomaly concentration + metric distribution.
- Chat widget: bounded explainability, no speculative claims.

## Accessibility
- Ensure mobile readability and keyboard operability.
- Maintain clear text alternatives for chart-heavy content.
- Keep color semantics backed by labels, not color alone.
